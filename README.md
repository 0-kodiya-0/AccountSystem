# AccountSystem

A comprehensive authentication microservice and SDK solution designed to provide secure, scalable user authentication for modern web applications.

## üéØ Overview

AccountSystem is a complete authentication infrastructure that has been extracted and refined from enterprise-grade applications. It provides a robust, production-ready authentication service along with easy-to-integrate SDKs for developers who want to add authentication to their applications without reinventing the wheel.

## üöÄ What This Project Solves

### The Authentication Challenge
Building secure authentication is complex and time-consuming. Most developers face:
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Implementing auth incorrectly can expose users to attacks
- **Feature Complexity**: Supporting multiple auth methods, 2FA, password reset, etc.
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Keeping auth code updated and secure
- **Integration Difficulties**: Making auth work across different platforms and frameworks
- **Scalability Issues**: Auth systems that don't scale with your application

### Our Solution
AccountSystem provides a complete authentication infrastructure that:
- ‚úÖ **Handles Security**: Battle-tested security implementations
- ‚úÖ **Supports Multiple Auth Methods**: Local (email/password), OAuth (Google, Microsoft, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Includes Advanced Features**: 2FA, password reset, account management
- ‚úÖ **Easy Integration**: Simple SDKs for popular frameworks
- ‚úÖ **Scales Automatically**: Microservice architecture that grows with your needs
- ‚úÖ **Saves Development Time**: Get auth working in minutes, not weeks

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

AccountSystem follows a microservice architecture with three main components:

### 1. **Authentication Backend**
A standalone Node.js/Express microservice that handles:
- User registration and authentication
- OAuth integration (Google, Microsoft, Facebook)
- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Password reset and email verification
- Session management and token handling
- Account settings and profile management

### 2. **Authentication Frontend**
A standalone React application providing:
- Complete authentication UI (login, signup, password reset)
- Account management interface
- 2FA setup and backup codes
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Can be used as-is or customized for your brand

### 3. **Authentication SDK**
Reusable libraries for easy integration:
- **React SDK**: Hooks, components, and context providers
- **JavaScript SDK**: Framework-agnostic authentication client
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type safety out of the box
- **Multiple Build Formats**: CommonJS, ES Modules, UMD

## üî• Key Features

### Authentication Methods
- **Local Authentication**: Email/password with secure password policies
- **OAuth Integration**: Google, Microsoft, Facebook (easily extensible)
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: TOTP-based 2FA with backup codes
- **Passwordless Options**: Magic links and social login

### Security Features
- **JWT Token Management**: Secure token generation and validation
- **Session Security**: Protection against session hijacking
- **Rate Limiting**: Brute force protection
- **Password Security**: Hashing, strength validation, breach detection
- **Account Lockout**: Automatic protection against attacks

### Developer Experience
- **Simple Integration**: Get started with just a few lines of code
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: API references, guides, and examples
- **TypeScript First**: Full type safety and excellent IDE support
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with React, Vue, Angular, vanilla JS
- **Customizable UI**: White-label ready components

### Enterprise Ready
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handles thousands of concurrent users
- **Database Support**: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **Email Integration**: SMTP, SendGrid, AWS SES
- **Monitoring**: Built-in logging and metrics
- **Docker Ready**: Easy deployment with containers

## üéØ Use Cases

### For Startups
- **Quick MVP**: Get authentication working in your app within hours
- **Security First**: Don't compromise on security while moving fast
- **Cost Effective**: No need to hire security specialists for auth

### For Enterprises
- **Microservice Architecture**: Fits perfectly into modern architectures
- **Compliance Ready**: Built with GDPR, CCPA considerations
- **Single Sign-On**: Central authentication for multiple applications
- **Audit Trails**: Complete logging for security audits

### For Developers
- **Focus on Core Features**: Stop building auth, start building your product
- **Best Practices**: Learn from production-tested implementations
- **Extensible**: Easy to customize and extend for specific needs

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Using the SDK (Recommended)
```bash
npm install @accountsystem/auth-sdk
```

```javascript
import { AuthClient, AuthProvider, useAuth } from '@accountsystem/auth-sdk';

// Initialize the auth client
const authClient = new AuthClient({
  baseUrl: 'https://your-auth-service.com',
  clientId: 'your-client-id'
});

// Wrap your app
function App() {
  return (
    <AuthProvider client={authClient}>
      <MyApp />
    </AuthProvider>
  );
}

// Use authentication in components
function MyApp() {
  const { user, login, logout, isAuthenticated } = useAuth();
  
  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return <button onClick={login}>Login</button>;
  }
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome, {user.name}!</h1>
      <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Self-Hosted Deployment
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AccountSystem.git
cd AccountSystem

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Start the services
docker-compose up -d

# Your auth service is now running at http://localhost:3000
```
